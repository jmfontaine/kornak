INSTALLATION
============

Kornak requires no special installation steps. Simply download the code,
extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in, and add its path
to your PHP include_path.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Kornak requires PHP 5.3 or later


CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH
============================

Once you have a copy of Kornak available, your application will need to
access the its classes. Though there are several ways to achieve this, your
PHP include_path needs to contain the path to the folder where you extracted
Kornak. You can find out more about the PHP include_path configuration directive
here:
