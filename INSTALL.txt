INSTALLATION
------------

Kajoa requires no special installation steps. Simply download the framework,
extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in, and add its path
to your PHP include_path.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Kajoa requires Zend Framework 1.7.0 and PHP 5.1.4 or later. Please note that
it works best with PHP 5.2.3 or later.

CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH
----------------------------

Once you have a copy of Kajoa available, your application will need to
access the framework classes. Though there are several ways to achieve this, your
PHP include_path needs to contain the path to the folder where you extracted
Kajoa. You can find out more about the PHP
include_path configuration directive here:
